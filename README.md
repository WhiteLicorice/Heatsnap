# Heatsnap

This is a repository for Heatsnap, a project that aims to determine the heat index of an outdoor environment out of a photo of its surroundings.

# Environment

We'll be using Keras with PyTorch in the backend. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory. 

These steps have been automated in `autosetup.bat`, in the event that `pip install -r requirements.txt` does not function correctly. To install manually, see the steps in `autosetup.bat`.
