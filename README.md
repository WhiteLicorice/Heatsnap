# Heatsnap

This is the repository for Heatsnap, a project that aims to train a deep learning model in determining the heat index of an outdoor environment out of its photo.

# Development

We'll be using Keras with PyTorch in the backend. Run `autosetup.bat` (NOT `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To install manually, see the steps in `autosetup.bat`.

# Dataset

We'll be using the [Skyfinder](https://cs.valdosta.edu/~rpmihail/skyfinder/) dataset. See the `data` directory for further instructions.
